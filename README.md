# Machine-Learning-Basics
Here i have worked on some of basics of ML and their different techniques . Also here i have predicted few data using a historical data set.

# Linear-Regression-ML-
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission 
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data. 
We use the Machine Learning technique called Simple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations. 
Go through code set by set to understand.


# Multiple-Regression-ML-
Now we make use of multiple attributes in a table to predict Co2 Emission for a new vehicle
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission.
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data.
We use the Machine Learning technique called Multiple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations.
Go through code set by set to understand.

# Polynomial-Regression-ML-
This is similar to linear regression but contains a curve line.
So we make use of polynomial equation to solve this process.
Go through the code and graph to understand better.

# Non-Linear-Regression-ML-
Non-linear regressions are a relationship between independent variables ùë• and a dependent variable ùë¶ which result in a non-linear function modeled data.
If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear.
In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.
