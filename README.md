# Machine-Learning-Basics
Here i have worked on some of basics of ML and their different techniques . Also here i have predicted few data using a historical data set.

# Linear-Regression-ML-
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission 
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data. 
We use the Machine Learning technique called Simple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations. 
Go through code set by set to understand.


# Multiple-Regression-ML-
Now we make use of multiple attributes in a table to predict Co2 Emission for a new vehicle
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission.
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data.
We use the Machine Learning technique called Multiple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations.
Go through code set by set to understand.

# Polynomial-Regression-ML-
This is similar to linear regression but contains a curve line
So we make use of polynomial equation to solve this process
Go through the code and graph to understand better
