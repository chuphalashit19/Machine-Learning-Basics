# Machine-Learning-Basics
Here i have worked on some of basics of ML and their different techniques . Also here i have predicted few data using a historical data set.

# Linear-Regression-ML-
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission 
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data. 
We use the Machine Learning technique called Simple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations. 
Go through code set by set to understand.


# Multiple-Regression-ML-
Now we make use of multiple attributes in a table to predict Co2 Emission for a new vehicle
Here we doing an assumption using a data set of car emission.
We assume co2 emission for a new car using the historical data.
We use the Machine Learning technique called Multiple Linear Regression to predict the data.
Also i make use of scikit learn to do some mathematical equations.
Go through code set by set to understand.

# Polynomial-Regression-ML-
This is similar to linear regression but contains a curve line.
So we make use of polynomial equation to solve this process.
Go through the code and graph to understand better.

# Non-Linear-Regression-ML-
Non-linear regressions are a relationship between independent variables ùë• and a dependent variable ùë¶ which result in a non-linear function modeled data.
If the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression because, as the name implies, linear regression presumes that the data is linear.
In this notebook, we fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014.

# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised learning.
Where the data is 'trained' with data points corresponding to their classification.
Once a point is to be predicted, it takes into account the 'K' nearest points to it to determine it's classification.
Here we have telecommunications provider as segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups.
The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service
Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
